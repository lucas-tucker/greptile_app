This is an agent endpoint with three tools. The agent is not so important, but
the tools are:
- load_repo_tool.py: loads repository via Greptile API call
- query_repo_tool.py: queries the repository via Greptile API call
- generate_diagram_tool.py: generates a diagram using Eraser.io's DiagramGPT based on conversation context
